## Introduction


The Python [JSON-NLP] module contains general mapping functions for [JSON-NLP] to CONLL-U, a validator for the generated output, an Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline interface (for [Flair], [spaCy], [NLTK], [Polyglot], [Xrenner], etc.), and various utility functions.



## Installation

For more details, see [JSON-NLP].

This module is a wrapper for outputs from different NLP pipelines and modules into a standardized [JSON-NLP] format.

To install this package, run the following command:

    pip install pyjsonnlp

You might have to use *pip3* on some systems.
